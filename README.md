# Drawing with HTML Canvas
As a developer, I want to learn how to use HTML Canvas so that I can draw graphics in my websites and apps. I also don’t want to be left behind, when my nerd friends start talking about Canvas-y things during our daily coffee sessions.

## Goals
- Set up canvas
- Draw shapes, paths, and images in canvas
- Add interactivity to canvas

## Summary
It’s really fun to work with graphics when building apps and websites, but how do you get started? HTML5 has a technology called Canvas that lets us draw graphics to our screens. We can do everything from making basic shapes to creating complex interactive games and animations. In this course, we will learn the basics of using canvas. We’ll start by learning how to create a canvas on an HTML page. Next we will learn how to draw and style with fills and strokes. Finally, we will add interactivity to canvas elements.
