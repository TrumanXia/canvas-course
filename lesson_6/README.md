# Drawing a piece of a pie in HTML Canvas
You might think that drawing a piece of a pie possible with the `arc` method. However, in this lesson, you'll see why that isn't possible and how to draw a pie piece with the `arcTo` canvas method. `arcTo` takes `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` and `radius` to draw a nifty arc shape. You then must use the `moveTo` and `lineTo` methods to complete the beautiful piece of a pie. As a bonus, the `clearRect` method is used to demonstrate clearing the canvas!
